\chapter{Statistical Testing}
This chapter describes SHOGUN's framework for statistical hypothesis testing. We begin by giving a brief outline of the problem setting in section \ref{sec:hypothesis_testing_into}. Then, we describe methods for two-sample testing for independence testing in section.

Methods for two-sample testing currently consist of tests based on the \emph{Maximum Mean Discrepancy}, section \ref{sec:mmd_into}. There are two types of tests available, a quadratic time test, which is described in section \ref{sec:mmd_quadratic}; and a linear time test, which is described in section \ref{sec:mmd_linear}. Both come in various flavours.

Independence testing is currently based in the \emph{Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion}, which is described in section \ref{sec:independence_testing_into} along with a test using it, which is described in section \ref{sec:hsic_test}

Projects only : Propose a topic of the Book Sprint and outline in a few sentences what you would like to cover.
The Shogun Machine Learning Toolbox offers a lot of powerful features. However, for new users, it might hard to get started. Even users from the scientific community sometimes struggle using it.
There are a lot of code examples available, but these only cover basic cases. Interface documentation exists, but is based on source-code comments. These are in many cases quite technical and more related to the internal framework than for end-user purpose. Documentation on the website is partly outdated.  What is missing is an all-in-one documentation which would take a user by the hand and guide him through all concepts and explains what is (not) possible with shogun.

This project aims to produce a good documentation of the project in the form of a book like manual.
We want to give a brief introduction into machine learning in general, and in particular want to explain algorithms implemented in shogun. For each algorithm we intend to introduce formal background, describe prerequisites, and point out the situations when it can or should be used. 

In addition, we want to illustrate how to use algorithm implementations in shogun in practice. For this, we aim to produce a real-life example for each algorithm and provide a step-by-step explanation. We plan to use public available and widely known datasets for this in order to maximize relevance.
These examples will be ordered by the class of the algorithms, i.e. classification, regression, clustering, etc. For example, classification algorithms could be illustrated utilizing the task to classify spam vs. non-spam or to recognize digits.

We already started a book like manual for shogun during GSoC 2012. Some of the students documented their projects in the above described form. See https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun-tutorial
We wanted to do a GSoC 2012 project on this, however, as GSoC is about coding this was not allowed. Therefore, the docsprint is an amazing opportunity for us to focus on a manual.

Projects only : List up to 5 individuals that you would like to attend. Please provide the country (and state if appropriate) they would travel from, and one or two lines about why each person is a good candidate. Indicate those who would require full or partial travel assistance.

Soeren Sonnenburg - http://sonnenburgs.de/soeren - Germany - Full travel support

Soeren started the project in 1999 and has since being the org admin during GSoC 2011/2012. He has a strong machine learning background and publication record. His PhD thesis and related publications can be used as input for certain parts of the documentation.

Sergey Lisitsyn <lisitsyn.s.o@gmail.com> - Russia - Full travel support

Sergey got involved in the GSoC 2011 and since then a core contributor touching all areas of shogun. He has successfully completed GSoC 2011/2012 and it was him who suggested to have a documentation sprint during GSoC 2012. He went ahead and documented his 2012 project in the shogun-tutorial.

Heiko Strathmann - http://www.herrstrathmann.de - UK (German nationality) - Full travel support

Heiko also got involved in the GSoC 2011 and since then a core contributor. He successfully completed GSoC 2011/2012. During the GSoC 2012, Heiko wrote an in-depth documentation for his project for the shogun-tuorial. He also documented  his acivity on his blog http://herrstrathmann.de/google-summer-of-code-blog
Since he is persuading an academic career in machine learning, he knows many of shogun's algorithms in detail and has experience in writing scientific documentation.

Viktor Gal <wiking@maeth.com> - Belgium - Full travel support

Viktor has started developing for Shogun in early 2012 followed by successfully completing GSoC 2012.
Viktor is continuously extending Shogun as part of his PhD, in which he is
working on various machine learning algorithms and their applications in machine vision.

Fernando J. Iglesias Garc√≠a - Sweden, (Spanish nationality) - <fernando.iglesiasg@gmail.com> - Full travel support

Fernando started contributing at the beginning of 2012 and sucessfully completed GSoC 2012, which he documented in his blog http://iglesiashogun.wordpress.com/
He is interested in machine learning applications to robotics and aims at becoming a successful researcher in this field.
